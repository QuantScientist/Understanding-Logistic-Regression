# Understanding Logistic Regression from Scratch

It is not that hard for ourselves to build a regression model from scratch (as we also demonstrated in [neural network](http://junma5.weebly.com/data-blog/build-your-own-neural-network-classifier-in-r)). In this project, I constructed a logistic regression algorithm from the base functions in R and compared it with `glm()`. The interpretation of logistic regression is more intuitive than other ML methods. I also used my model to find the FG% given shot clock, shot distance and defender distance.
